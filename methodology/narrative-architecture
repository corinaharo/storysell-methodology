Narrative Architecture

Narrative Architecture is the backbone of the StorySell Methodology.
It is the system that transforms raw insights into persuasive, clear, and emotionally compelling communication.

## 1. Structure of a Brand Narrative

A strong narrative consists of:

The Core Message – What you stand for

The Big Truth – What your audience must understand

Supporting Proof – Why you are credible

Value Layers – Emotional, functional, social

Story Arcs – How your story unfolds over time

Brand Voice System – How you speak and show up

## 2. Messaging Pyramid
      [ Core Narrative ]
         ↓
   [ Value Proposition ]
         ↓
 [ Key Messages / Claims ]
         ↓
[ Supporting Evidence ]
         ↓
 [ Storytelling Moments ]


This ensures coherence from high-level strategy to daily content.

## 3. Narrative Elements
